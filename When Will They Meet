'''1)ram and hanuman measure and find that their houses are 50 miles apart. if they agree to meet at the midpoint between their two houses,
how far will each of them travel in kilometers?(HINT: 1mile = 1.6 kms)'''
distance =50*2.5
mid_point=distance/2
print(f'ram and hanuman houses are far with a distance of {distance}kms \nthey meet at a mid point {distance-mid_point}in kms')
