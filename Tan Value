'''mani is learning about the python library math.h functions.
he found that there is tan() function in math header file.
he wants to calculate tan45o, but he finds that tan funtion accepts on radians.help
mani to convert 45o to radians and calculate the value of tan45o.

input:45
output:tan value of 45'''

from math import *
degree=int(input("enter degree"))
radian=radians(degree)
tan_value= tan(radian)
print(tan_value)
